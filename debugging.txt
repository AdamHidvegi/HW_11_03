Answer the following questions:
1. What is the purpose of a breakpoint?

  At the breakpoint the program will pause the application and launch the debugger console for further actions.

2. Does the line of code on a breakpoint run when you start debugging?

  Yes. When we set up a breakpoint, the program pauses the application right before that specific line. So during the debugging process that line will be the first what will run.

3. How do we debug the next line of code?

  We can use the "step over" button on the debugger console.

4. What does the step into command do?

  This command will switch to the method we are testing and pause at the top of the method.

5. What is the difference between evaluate expression and evaluate code fragment?

  Evaluate code fragment: we can evaluate and run multiple methods.
  Evaluate expression: we can evaluate and run only one method.
